While curating a list of new tracks to add to a "musicdisk" style 
gamerom, I found it useful to examine the video game that inspired me to 
make a musicdisk in the first place. *Destiny*, in Year One, had an 
excellent playlist that ran while you were waiting with your ship in 
orbit, and I often left the game running in that state just for some 
soothing ambiance.

I tracked down someone's hour-long video of the *Destiny* orbit music 
from that year and scoured the original soundtrack to find the track 
names used and make notes about the track lengths. All of the orbit 
music is on the original soundtrack, selected for a maximum run length 
of just over 2:00 per track and often as little as 1:00. In addition, 
sometimes it plays an excerpt of one of these tracks that fades out 
after 45 to 55 seconds, or maybe a bit longer. Nonetheless the tracks 
are always selected from the following set of eight.

- Track 03 Excerpt from The Hope (2:17)
- Track 04 Excerpt from The Ecstasy (2:11)
- Track 06 The Guardian (2:08)
- Track 09 The Collapse (1:34)
- Track 14 The Great Unknown (1:35)
- Track 15 Excerpt 1 from The Rose (1:24)
- Track 16 Excerpt from The Tribulation (2:15)
- Track 21 Reborn (2:05)

The playlist always seems to start with *The Great Unknown*, and the 
sort of static noise that begins that track seems to continue at a low 
volume behind the rest of the music, which provides a rather interesting 
undercurrent.

I also took note of the feel of each track. There are two mysterious 
tracks, two melancholy tracks, two inspirational tracks, and two 
anthems. Taking these notes into account, I should curate the playlist 
for my musicdisk to have a good mix of such genres, and focus on tracks 
that fade out after about 1:30 on average.
