I'm a computer programmer and game developer currently working on a 
library of open-source retro games for personal computers and game 
consoles. Two of my major accomplishments are an award-winning bonus 
level for ReTux and a holiday-themed contest-winning GameBoy ROM.

My growing commercial library can be found at my [itch.io 
profile](https://optimusdu.itch.io/) and my bonus level is bundled with 
the official [ReTux](https://retux-game.github.io/) releases. My game 
are is available at my [OpenGameArt 
profile](https://opengameart.org/users/OptimusDu)
