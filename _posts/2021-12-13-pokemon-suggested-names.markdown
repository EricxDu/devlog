Beginning with the first generation, American Pokemon cartridges 
presented a player with a list of suggested names to use for their 
character, as well as the option to enter a custom name. I couldn't find 
anyone documenting this minutae for the internet, so I did a quick dive 
into the first three generations of Pokemon versions to take notes.

Pokemon Red Version and Pokemon Blue Version (c'95'96'98) has two lists 
of names to choose from. One list is for your character's name and one 
is for your rival's name. If you play Pokemon Red Version, you get the 
red list for your character and the blue list for your rival, and vice 
versa.

- RED
- ASH
- JACK

- BLUE
- GARY
- JOHN

Pokemon Yellow Version (c1995-1999) gives you the same choices as 
Pokemon Red Version, except with YELLOW as the first name for your 
character above ASH and JACK.

Red and Blue went on to become the canonical names of the main 
character's from Generation I, while Ash and Gary became the names of 
the characters in the anime. I don't know what became of Jack and John; 
perhaps there is a fan-fiction published about their adventures and 
rivalry.

Pokemon Gold Version and Pokemon Silver Version (c2000) each give you 
only one list from which to choose your character's name, but the 
contents of the list is different depending on the version.

- GOLD
- HIRO
- TAYLOR
- KARL

- SILVER
- KAMON
- OSCAR
- MAX

This is the latest version to offer a first name identical to the 
version of the game. Pokemon Crystal Version (c2001) was the first 
version to give you one out of two different lists depending on whether 
you chose for your chracter to be a "boy" or a "girl".

- Boy
  + CHRIS
  + MAT
  + ALLAN
  + JON

- Girl
  + KRIS
  + AMANDA
  + JUANA
  + JODI

This version does carry on the tradition of the first name having 
something to do with the version name, as CHRIS and KRIS are both in the 
first syllable of the word "crystal".

Pokemon Ruby Version and Pokemon Sapphire Version (c2003) again give you 
the choice of making your character a "boy" or a "girl", but each 
version offers different first names for each list.

- Boy
  + Ruby Version: LANDON
  + Sapphire Version: SEAN
  + TERRY
  + SETH
  + TOM

- Girl
  + Ruby Version: TERRA
  + Sapphire Version: MARINA
  + KIMMY
  + NICOLA
  + SARA

These versions arguably continue the associative tradition of first name 
choice, because both LANDON and TERRA have something to do with earth 
(land-on and terrain), while both SEAN and MARINA have something to do 
with ocean (o-sean and marine).
